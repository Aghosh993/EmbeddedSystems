Library note:

To use these libraries, you must copy them to the Arduino "libraries" 
folder. This exists somewhere on your system, within the Arduino 
installation folder where you installed the IDE. on Linux, I installed 
Arduino to /home/<myusername>/Arduino. Thus, I placed the libraries in 
/home/<myusername>/Arduino/libraries/ and re-started the IDE.

These libraries are NOT my own, but are rather the open-source work of 
Adafruit. Please go to: 
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm9ds0-accelerometer-gyro-magnetometer-9-dof-breakouts/wiring-and-test 
for more info and links to the latest versions of the libraries I have 
placed in this repo.
